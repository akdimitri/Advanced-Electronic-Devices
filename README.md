Abstract - MOSFET performance parameters are introduced and
used in theoretical analysis of short channel effects. Possible
optimizations of these effects are then introduced. The theory is
then applied in TCAD simulations of a short channel Silicon
MOSFET with a gate length of 225nm and performance is
compared to that of a device with a 1000nm gate length.
Optimizations yield improvements in all performance parameters
when compared to the unoptimized short channel device. A DIBL
of 6.84 mV/V at a threshold voltage of 0.48V, and a subthreshold
swing of 62.77mV/Dec. Improvement is also seen when compared
to the long channel in all areas except for output conductance,
which remains largely unaffected by the optimizations applied.

Abstract—Nano-wire GAAFET of 8nm radius are studied with
both Ohmic and Schottky contacts, and with and without self
heating effects. An additional novel CIGAAFET with Ohmic
contacts is also explored. Despite a series of simulation difficulties,
the performance of these devices are extracted, and analysed.
The CIGAAFET is found to produce a maximum Ion=Ioff =
1.68E + 09. Self heating effects were found to cause a current
reduction of 11% − 12% in devices with Ohmic contacts, with
minimal impact on the Schottky device. In all cases, the GAAFET
is shown to be an effective solution for achieving acceptable
performance at this scale, despite the additional non-idealities
the device presents.
